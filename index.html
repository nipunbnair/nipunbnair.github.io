        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>The primary aim of my research is to democratize the capabilities of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) by extending its reach to encompass a multitude of Indic languages. With the advent of cutting-edge technologies like Generative AI, the potential for creative content generation, language translation, and cultural expression has surged remarkably. However, there exists a notable gap in its application to Indic languages, which are rich in diversity and heritage. By bridging this gap, my research endeavors to empower communities that communicate through Indic languages to leverage Generative AI for content creation, communication, and artistic expression. This pursuit holds the promise of not only preserving and revitalizing linguistic traditions but also fostering innovation and inclusivity in the digital era.</p>
