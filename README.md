# Nipun B Nair

I am a final-year Computer science and Artificial Intelligence major at Amrita Vishwa Vidhyapeetham, Bangalore, where my main interests lie in the **Generative AI** field. Outside of class, my research primarily includes democratizing generative AI into various indic languages. My other hobbies include dancing, singing, writing, chess, cricket, movies and learning new languages.

## Research

The primary aim of my research is to democratize the capabilities of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) by extending its reach to encompass a multitude of Indic languages. With the advent of cutting-edge technologies like Generative AI, the potential for creative content generation, language translation, and cultural expression has surged remarkably. However, there exists a notable gap in its application to Indic languages, which are rich in diversity and heritage. By bridging this gap, my research endeavors to empower communities that communicate through Indic languages to leverage Generative AI for content creation, communication, and artistic expression. This pursuit holds the promise of not only preserving and revitalizing linguistic traditions but also fostering innovation and inclusivity in the digital era.

### Using Deep Learning Hybrid Net

**Sujay Nair**, Kyle Pearson

2021

In this project, we train a 1D Convolutional Neural Network to take as input artificially generated light curves mimicking TESS observations at a 2 min cadence and output a list with predicted planetary parameters-namely, Rp/Rs, Period, a/Rs, and T-mid. Comparing to the current state of the art algorithm, Transit Least Squares (TLS), which does not rely on machine learning, our Rp/Rs mean absolute error is roughly the same. We are still tuning the model to reach TLS performance for Period.
