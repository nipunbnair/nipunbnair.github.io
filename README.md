# Sujay Nair

I am a first-year math and CS double major at Georgia Institute of Technology, where my main interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and gaming/astronomy. Outside of class, my research primarily studies exoplanets and computational tools to identify them and measure their transit timings. My other hobbies include pottery, chess, basketball, and football.

## Research

The goals of my research are to utilize computational tools like machine learning to detect and predict exoplanet transit parameters given a light curve and enable citizen scientists/amateur astronomers to do meaningful research in this space. I also want to explore the application of RL agents to beat video games.

### Using Deep Learning to Predict Exoplanet Planetary Parameters based on Generated Light Curves

**Sujay Nair**, Kyle Pearson

2021

In this project, we train a 1D Convolutional Neural Network to take as input artificially generated light curves mimicking TESS observations at a 2 min cadence and output a list with predicted planetary parameters-namely, Rp/Rs, Period, a/Rs, and T-mid. Comparing to the current state of the art algorithm, Transit Least Squares (TLS), which does not rely on machine learning, our Rp/Rs mean absolute error is roughly the same. We are still tuning the model to reach TLS performance for Period.

This summarizes my research in the area of updating exoplanet transits, crowd-sourcing the exoplanet transit effort, and deep learning for exoplanet detection.

### Sequence-based Encoding of Light Curves for Exoplanet Detection

**Sujay Nair**, Kyle Pearson

*AAS 238*, 2021

We explore the benefits of using recurrent neural networks for predicting the existence of an exoplanet. We tested LSTM layers in our Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) versus our standard CNN with synthetically generated light curves with varying amounts of noise.
